# My Take on Sleep as an IT Student

As a night owl and an IT student, I’ve definitely felt the impact of irregular sleep patterns. My bedtime schedule? Pretty chaotic. But after reading about [how important sleep is for software engineers](https://x-team.com/blog/how-to-optimize-your-sleep), I’m starting to realize it’s time to tidy things up.

I’ve been staying up way too late, caught up in code or binge-watching shows, but I’m ready to make a change. I’m going to try setting a consistent bedtime, cutting back on late-night screen time, and maybe even taking a morning walk to soak up some sunlight. It’s about time I give my brain the rest it deserves so I can keep up with my projects and, you know, actually feel awake during the day.

Making these changes won’t be easy, but I’m excited to see how they improve my focus and coding skills. Here’s to better sleep and better code!
