# Finding Balance: A Journey to Prioritizing Physical and Mental Health as a Junior IT Student

As a junior IT student, I've spent countless hours immersed in code, striving to meet deadlines, and pushing myself to master new technologies. But in the midst of this hustle, I began to notice something troubling—my physical and mental health were slowly deteriorating. I’d always assumed that if I worked hard enough, everything else would fall into place. Yet, the more I ignored my well-being, the more I felt overwhelmed, stressed, and stuck in a cycle of self-doubt.

It was during one particularly tough week, where everything seemed to go wrong, that I realized I needed to make a change. I was exhausted, both physically and mentally, and it became clear that I couldn’t keep ignoring the signals my body and mind were sending me. I had to start treating myself with the same care and attention I gave to my projects and studies.

The first step in my journey was committing to positive self-talk. I had developed a habit of being my own harshest critic, and it was wearing me down. I decided to flip the script, choosing instead to speak to myself as I would to a close friend—kindly, patiently, and with understanding. This shift wasn’t easy at first. Years of negative self-talk had created deep grooves in my mind, and it took conscious effort to carve new, positive pathways.

Along with this, I learned to block and replace negative thoughts as soon as they appeared. Whenever I found myself spiraling into self-criticism, I would pause, challenge the thought, and replace it with something constructive. This practice helped me disrupt harmful patterns and slowly build a healthier mindset. It felt like learning to ride a bike—wobbly and uncertain at first, but with time, I gained confidence.

Another key part of my journey was learning to speak to myself like a supportive coach. I started to acknowledge my efforts, no matter how small they seemed. Whether it was finishing an assignment or simply making it through a tough day, I made sure to recognize my own perseverance. This approach helped me build a foundation of self-worth that wasn’t based on inflated ego, but on real, tangible accomplishments.

As I continued these practices, I noticed a virtuous cycle emerging. The more I stopped criticizing myself and started recognizing my strengths, the easier it became to accept and love myself. This wasn’t a linear process, and there were setbacks along the way, but each small victory added up, creating momentum that carried me forward.

Patience became another crucial lesson. I realized that self-love is a journey that takes time. The initial efforts felt awkward and uncomfortable, but as I persisted, I began to see progress. It wasn’t about rushing to a destination; it was about committing to the path, no matter how long it took.

I also began focusing on developing qualities that made me easier to love—not just by others, but by myself. I worked on being more compassionate, more understanding, and more patient with myself. This shift not only improved my relationships with others but also deepened my own sense of self-compassion.

Finally, I found strength in community. Sharing my journey with others, whether through conversations or online communities, reinforced my own progress. It was comforting to know that I wasn’t alone, and that others were also striving to find balance in their lives. This sense of connection enhanced my motivation and accountability, making the journey a little less daunting.
